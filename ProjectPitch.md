## The Problem
Nobody likes being a part of a group project. Working with strangers and sharing ideas with them can be awkward. Your own input can get can go unheard by the larger group. How can we make group projects fun and efficent?



# Introducing CollabQuest




## CollabQuest's Solution 
CollabQuest creates a space where collaboration can thrive. Our website serves as a home base for members working on a project together. Users create a profile through our easy-to-use account system. This gives users access to CollabQuest's library of projects. Users can upload their own projects or start working on an existing idea. CollabQuest uses a mixture of XAMP, infinityfree, and Bootstrap to build its framework. To code CollabQuest, our group used html, CSS, JS, and PHP.
  
## Why We Need CollabQuest 
Solving this problem allows for the creation of many more incredible projects. So many people have ideas and concepts, but may not have the necessary skills to make their ideas a reality. CollabQuest allows anyone to find other passionate people to work with, and discover projects they're interested in applying their skills to. The cost of solving this problem is minimal, but not solving it potentially leads to incredible ideas not being fully realized and created.

## Going Forward
Moving forward, we believe that CollabQuest can only get bigger. A website with the access to multiple opportunities can show developers other ideas programmers are creating and where they can help. For the audience, it allows for different users/programmers to analyze code errors in projects posted. Going forward, we want to make sure that all facets of CollabQuest's website work properly and perform in the way we intended them to. The initial idea at the heart of CollabQuest creates a community of people working together to push limits.
