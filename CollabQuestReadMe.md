Where Ideas Come Together 

## Motivation 
CollabQuest is dedicated to creating a space for sharing and developing projects. We want to make group projects an efficent and fun process where everybody can contribute. 

## Build Status

## Code Style
The languages used are html, CSS, JS, and PHP. All of the html pages were created as PHP files, as this allowed for the inclusion of PHP code directly into the html. Each database feature was made in a separate file and connected back to its page, and each section had its own CSS file as well. A bootstrap template was used as an inital template for the creation of the home page.
## Tech/Framework Used 
XAMPP, which includes: Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for the PHP and Perl programming languages, was used to initially create the web site/server locally initially and to test the databases. The dynamic hosting site infinityfree was then used to host the data and site. For the landing page, we used the Bootstrap framework as a starting point. 
## Features 
The current features implemented are a basic account system and the ability to create & browse posts of different projects.
